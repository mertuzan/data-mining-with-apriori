=== 1. Chicago Crimes Dataset (2012-2017)

Association rule mining on the relationship between the places near the crime and the arrest.

For example, if the school is a rule, Every crime committed near the school is resulting in arrest.

Datasets: Chicago Crimes Dataset, Places Dataset which we created via Google Places API and Google Geocoding API.

Chicago Crime Dataset Columns:

* ID : Case ID
* Date : Case Date
* Primary Type : Crime Type
* Location Description : Crime Location
* Arrest : Is arrested ? (True or False)
* Latitude : Latitude value
* Longitude : Longitude value

Places Dataset Columns:

* ID : Case ID same with Crime Dataset
* Place : Place type (university,restaurant etc.)
* Name : Place name (Kocaeli University etc.)
* Distance : Distance from crime location

=== 2. Eastbound Dataset

Association rule mining on the relationship between the car features and the cars which go east.

For example, if the open car is a rule, Every car with that feature goes east.

Eastbound Dataset Columns:

* Car : Car ID
* Direction : East or west
* Shape : Car shape (rectangle, hexagon etc.)
* Wheel : Number of wheel (2 or 3)
* Length : Car length (short or long)
* closed : Is car closed ? (true or false)
* jagged : Is car jagged ? (true of false)
* Load : Type of load
* open_car : Is car open ? (true or false)
* tr_double : True or false
